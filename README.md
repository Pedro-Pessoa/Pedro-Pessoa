### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I?
I'm just a guy who has a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/PedroPessoa) and wanted to create a discord server for my community.<br>
Once you create a discord server, you go on the venture of finding the bots that suit your needs.<br>
I found [yagpdb](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb) and was initially only interessed on it's tweet feed feature.<br>
But I soon found out it had a custom command freature that used go's `text/template` package.<br>
It was my first time ever messing around with any kind of code.<br>
Once I started finding the limitations of those custom commands, I wanted to start making changes to the bot source code itself.<br>
[Jonas](https://github.com/jonas747) is an awesome dude and made the whole bot open-source and under a MIT license.<br>
From there, I started working on my own version of the bot and here I am.
